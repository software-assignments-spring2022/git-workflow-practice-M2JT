[Difference Between Software Engineer and Software Developer](https://devskiller.com/software-engineer-vs-software-developer/)

## Comment

I found this article interesting because it explains the difference between software engineers and software developers, as I used to get confused when trying to differentiate between them. In short, as Mr. Stowe summarizes, when it comes to problem solving, software developers tend to come up with creative solutions, while software engineers tend to take a more precise, systematic approach to the problem at hand and "minimi[ize] trade-offs to other parts of the system and its architecture." In addition, while they are both considered highly skilled professionals, software engineers generally have broad experience in different fields, while software developers "tend to have domain-specific technical expertise."
